### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Elizabeth, and I am a self-taught data analyst currently residing in NYC. With a background in food service management, I have paved my own way from exploring sales data within the companies I have worked for and transformed them into meaningful stories.

Currently, I am...
- ðŸ”­ Working on building more case studies!
- ðŸŒ± Learning Python, PostgreSQL
- :memo: Putting a database together tracking my mood and what may be influencing it every day. I post updates weekly, so stay tuned! 

:wrench: My Toolbox:

:chart_with_upwards_trend: Databases: SQL (MySQL, SQL Server, Google BigQuery), Excel, R

:bar_chart: Visualization: Tableau, Looker Studio

- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned how to make cheese from scratch in Italy!
